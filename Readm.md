The files 3rdNT.txt and the 4thNT.txt files are labeled as non-trivial topological materials (NT). We run a Python code to look for any common materials that may occur in these two files.
The files contain materials along with their spacegroup number. These materials are all 3D materials. 
The file 1stT.txt contains materials labeled as trivial materials. Although we mark these materials as trivial, there may be actual materials that are NT among them.
The 2ndT.txt file contains the data on which we run our trained model for the final classification purpose. We then write them into an Excel file for data processing and feature engineering.
